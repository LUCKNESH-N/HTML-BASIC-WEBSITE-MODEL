<h1 style="font-family:Trebuchet MS"> IS CELL AND BATTERY SAME? AND WHAT IS C RATING OF A BATTERY?</h1>
<pre style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;color:white;">
<i><strong><bold>Cells</bold></strong></i> are the smallest individual electrochemical unit, and
deliver a voltage that depends on the cell chemistry
There are primary (single use) and secondary
(rechargeable) cell
A cell is different from a battery, but many people
(including me at times!) use the term “battery” to
describe any electrochemical energy source,
even if it is a single cell, and this can lead to
confusion.

<i><strong><bold>Batteries</bold></strong></i> and battery packs are made up from groups of cells
These cells can be wired together in series
in parallel, or in some combination of both
Sometimes they are packaged in a single
physical unit
For example, automotive 12 V lead-acid
batteries comprise six 2 V cells in series
Other times, the connections are external to
the cells


<i><strong><bold>The C rate</bold></strong></i> is a relative measure of cell electrical current
It is the constant-current charge or discharge rate that
the cell can <strong>sustain for one hour</strong>
A 20 Ah cell should be able to deliver 20 A (“1C”) for
1 h or 2 A (“C/10”) for about 10 h 
(but, the relationship is not strictly linear)
If the cell is discharged at a 10C rate, it will be completely
discharged in about six minutes

<strong>Example: The 1C rate of the example to the right is 1 9A
